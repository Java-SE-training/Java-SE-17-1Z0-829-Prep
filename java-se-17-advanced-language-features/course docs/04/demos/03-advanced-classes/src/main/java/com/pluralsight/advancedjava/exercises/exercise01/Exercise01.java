 *       Add a method named "run" to class "Nested", which is void and takes no parameters.
 *       In the "run" method, call the static method in the enclosing class and print what it returns (using System.out.println(...)).
 *       Run the included unit test {@link Exercise01Test} to check if you have done this correctly.
